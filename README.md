# Day-1-Project-Linear-Regression-Airline-Prices
I used a csv file from Kaggle containing info of airlines and more. I made Linear Regression Model to predict the pricing with the ordinal columns.  

The model I created is not good. You have a way to get better data or advice for me please tell me!

I will be making projects daily until I obtain a job opportunity to program remotely!
